# Analyzing-Crimes-in-Chicago
Using the Chicago Data Portal https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-present/ijzp-q8t2 I analyzed 5.3 million reported crimes in Chicago from 2003 to 2018, and then narrowed my focus to 2018. 
What factors contribute to a crime being violent or property related?Â¶
Where/When Violent or Property crimes may occur?
Overall crime, as categorized either 'Violent' or 'Property' related, has steadily declined year over year.

The homicide rate also decreased as well.

Crimes involving a gun resulted in incidents categorized as 'Violent', though not all violent crimes included a weapon.

Violent crimes were more related to the day (weekend), where as Property crimes were associated to the hour.
