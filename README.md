# Analyzing-Crimes-in-Chicago
Chicago has frequently made the news for its high murder rate and gun violence, including being admonished by the Trump Administration in 2017. However, overall crime and homicides decreased year over year, making the city safer today despite what various news sources report.
The Chicago Data Portal https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-present/ijzp-q8t2, was used.
This project utilizes supervised and unsupervised learning techniques to analyze reported crimes across Chicago (specifically crimes that are classified as either Violent, or Property related), from 2003 through 2018. Further exploration continues for crimes reported in 2018. The readers of this report will be able to understand the following upon completion:

1. Is Chicago safer today?
2. What factors contribute to a crime being violent or property related?
3. Where/When Violent or Property crimes may occur?Â¶
